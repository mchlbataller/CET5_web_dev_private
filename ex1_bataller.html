    <h1>Try React</h1>
    <p>
      React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can
      use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a
      taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a
      complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get
      started.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <b> Online Playgrounds </b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you’re <strong>interested</strong> in playing around with React,
      <i>you can use an online code playground.</i> Try a Hello World template
      on <mark>CodePen, CodeSandbox, Glitch, or Stackblitz</mark>.
    </p>

      If you <em>prefer to use your own text editor</em>, you can also download
      this HTML file, edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your
      browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so we’d only
      recommend using this for simple demos.

    <h3>
      <big> Add React to a Website </big>
    </h3>
    <p>
      You can add
      <ins>React to an HTML page in <del>ten minutes</del> one minute.</ins> You
      can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a
      few dynamic widgets.
    </p>

    <h2>Create a New React App</h2>
    <p>
      When starting a React project, a simple HTML page with script tags might
      still be the best option. <sup>It only takes a minute to set up!</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      As your application grows, you might want to consider a more integrated
      setup. There are several JavaScript toolchains we recommend for larger
      applications. Each of them can work with little to no configuration and
      lets you take full advantage of the rich React ecosystem.
